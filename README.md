# Project 1 (Due 1/22 3PM Eastern Time)
For Project 1, you'll use this project as a template to complete, refactor, and add additional functionalities of your choice.

On 1/22, we'll do a informal presentation of our projects

## Setting Up
The recommended practice when working with project locally is to set up a virtual environment.

You should also have .env file containing environment variables specific to this project.

Refer to the notes from Week 2 Day 3 for instructions on both.

Once everything is done, you can install required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the app, simply run `py app.py`

## Requirements
- The application should function and should be able to answer questions from a given context
- It should also have at least 2 additional functionalities of your choice

## Ideas for refactor and additional functionalities
- Refactor the application to multiple files 
- Expand to a main function + various other methods
- Add a text UI
- Change the prompt. Give the LLM different persona. (Customer Service bot? Ordering bot?)
- Use multiple sources as context
- Load external files as context
